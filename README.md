# Jest Tools
**Note: this library is not ready for release yet**

A set of tools to take your jest testing to the next level.
Right now this mainly targets React Native. however it would be great if
anyone wanted to contribute React or other helpers as well.

## Todo:
- need to cleanup the configuration setup to give more access to
the underlaying libraries, e.g. WD and Appium

- finish up the cli tools
## Features
- easily write end to end automated tests using Web Driver and Appium
- clean up your tests by using helpers
- write better tests by easily mocking sub modules
